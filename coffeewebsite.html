        <p>A study review of clinical trails found that drinking coffee is generally safe<br> within usual level of intake and is more likely to improve bealth outcomes<br> than to cause harm at doses of 3 or 4 cups of coffe daily. Exceptions include<br> possible increased risk in the women having bone fracture, and a possible<br> increase risk in pregnat women of foetal loss or decreased birth weight.<br>
            Result were complicated by poor study quality, and difference in age,<br>

        <p>TYPES</p>
    </div>

    <div class="para2"><p>Coffee beans are the seeds of a fruit called a coffee cherry.Coffee cherries grow on coffee trees from agenus of plants called coffea.There are a wide variety of species of coffee plants,ranging from shrubs to trees.</p></div>
<div>
 <ul>
    <li class="list1"><b>Type of bean. </b>There are two main types of coffee species.Arabica and Robusta.Arabica originates from Ethiopia and produces a mild,flavorful tasting coffee.It is the most popular type worldwide.However, it is expensive to grow because the Arabica plant is sensitive to the environment, requiring shade, humidity and temperatures between 60-75 degrees Fahrenheit.The Robusta coffee plant is more economical to grow because it is resistant to disease and survives in a wider range of temperatures between 65-97 degrees Fahrenheit.It can also withstand harsh climatechanges such as variations in rainfall and strong sunlight.
    </li>

    <li class="list1"><b>Type of roast.</b>Coffee beans start out green. They are roasted at a high heat to produce a chemical change that releases the rich aroma and flavor t associate with coffee. They are then cooled and ground for brewing. Roasting levels range from light to medium to dark. The lighter the roast, lighter the
        color and roasted flavor and the higher its acidity. Dark roasts produce a black bean with little acidity and a bitter roasted flavor. The popular French roast is medium-dark.</li>
    
    <li class="list1"><b>Type of grind.</b>A medium grind is the most common and used for automatic drip coffee makers. A fine grind is used for deeper flavors like espresso, which releases the oils, and a coarse grind is used in coffee presses</li>
    
    <li class="list1"><b>Decaffeinated coffee</b>Like all coffee, decaffeinated coffee is safe for consumption and can be part of a healthy diet.If you are wondering whether the decaffeination process itself is safe, the answer is yes. All four methods are safe, and once the caffeine is removed (well, at least 97% of it), the beans are washed, steamed, and roasted at temperatures that evaporate the liquids used in decaffeination.</li>
